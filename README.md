# 🧐 Motivation
### I was tired of manually installing and configuring my Arch Linux after a restoration, and I decided to automatize this.

## 🔨 Build requirements
- Git
- Lua Language

## 🏃 How to run
1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/clonidine/arch-setup.git`
2. Enter inside the generated directory: `cd arch-setup`
3. Run: `lua setup.lua`
